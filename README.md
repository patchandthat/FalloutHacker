This app solves terminals in Fallout 4.  I was tired of working out the solutions by hand.

Work in progress: monitoring the game's screenshot directory and reading the terminal automatically from screensot images.
The OCR engine relies on visual studio 2012 runtimes [which can be downloaded here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679).
